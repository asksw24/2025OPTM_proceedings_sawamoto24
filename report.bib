  abstract  = "AbstractSociety has become increasingly reliant on plastics since
               commercial production began in about 1950. Their versatility,
               stability, light weight, and low production costs have fueled
               global demand. Most plastics are initially used and discarded on
               land. Nonetheless, the amount of microplastics in some oceanic
               compartments is predicted to double by 2030. To solve this global
               problem, we must understand plastic composition, physical forms,
               uses, transport, and fragmentation into microplastics (and
               nanoplastics). Plastic debris/microplastics arise from land
               disposal, wastewater treatment, tire wear, paint failure, textile
               washing, and at‐sea losses. Riverine and atmospheric transport,
               storm water, and disasters facilitate releases. In surface waters
               plastics/microplastics weather, biofoul, aggregate, and sink, are
               ingested by organisms and redistributed by currents. Ocean
               sediments are likely the ultimate destination. Plastics release
               additives, concentrate environmental contaminants, and serve as
               substrates for biofilms, including exotic and pathogenic species.
               Microplastic abundance increases as fragment size decreases, as

               risks. Solutions include improving globally based pollution
               prevention, developing degradable polymers and additives, and

               necessitating the development of efficient analytical strategies

               study aims to define an optimal analytical protocol for
               characterizing MPs by hyperspectral imaging (HSI), comparing
               different setups based on spatial resolution, spectral range and
               classification models. The investigated MPs include polymers
               commonly found in the environment, such as polystyrene (PS),
               polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE),
               subdivided in three size classes (1000-2000 μm, 500-1000 μm,
               250-500 μm). Furthermore, MP particles with diameters ranging
               from 30 to 250 μm were assessed to determine the limit of
               detection (LOD) in the different configurations. Hyperspectral
               images were acquired with two spatial resolutions, 150 and 30
               μm/pixel, and two spectral ranges, 1000-1700 nm (NIR) and
               1000-2500 nm (SWIR). Three classification models, Partial Least
               Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Error Correction Output
               Coding-Support Vector Machine (ECOC-SVM) and Neural Network
               Pattern Recognition (NNPR) were tested on the acquired images.
               The correctness of these models was evaluated by prediction maps
               and statistical parameters (Recall, Specificity and Accuracy).
               The results demonstrated that for MP particles larger than 250
               μm, the optimal setup is a spatial resolution of 150 μm/pixel and
               a spectral range of 1000-1700 nm, utilizing a linear
               classification model like PLS-DA. This approach offers accurate
               predictions while being time- and cost-efficient. For MPs smaller
               than 250 μm, a higher spatial resolution of 30 μm/pixel with a
               spectral range of 1000-2500 nm and a non-linear classification
               method like ECOC-SVM is preferable. The LOD is 250 μm for the 150
               μm/pixel resolution and ranges from 100 to 200 μm for the 30
               μm/pixel resolution. These findings provide a valuable guide for
               selecting the appropriate HSI acquisition conditions and data
               processing methods to optimally characterize MPs of different
               sizes.",

               Hence, an approach of using fluorescence fingerprints (FFs) for

               marine environment. Three main sampling strategies were
               identified: selective, volume-reduced, and bulk sampling. Most
               sediment samples came from sandy beaches at the high tide line,
               and most seawater samples were taken at the sea surface using
               neuston nets. Four steps were distinguished during sample
               processing: density separation, filtration, sieving, and visual
               sorting of microplastics. Visual sorting was one of the most
               commonly used methods for the identification of microplastics
               (using type, shape, degradation stage, and color as criteria).
               Chemical and physical characteristics (e.g., specific density)
               were also used. The most reliable method to identify the chemical
               composition of microplastics is by infrared spectroscopy. Most
               studies reported that plastic fragments were polyethylene and
               polypropylene polymers. Units commonly used for abundance
               estimates are ``items per m(2)'' for sediment and sea surface
               studies and ``items per m(3)'' for water column studies. Mesh
               size of sieves and filters used during sampling or sample
               processing influence abundance estimates. Most studies reported
               two main size ranges of microplastics: (i) 500 μm-5 mm, which are
               retained by a 500 μm sieve/net, and (ii) 1-500 μm, or fractions
               thereof that are retained on filters. We recommend that future
               programs of monitoring continue to distinguish these size
               fractions, but we suggest standardized sampling procedures which
               allow the spatiotemporal comparison of microplastic abundance

               fecal matter and ingesta during slaughter and processing. Since

               Fluorescence imaging has proven its potential for the detection
               of fecal residue but requires expertise to interpret. In order to
               be used by meat cutters without special training, automated

               range, reflection, and fluorescence spectra present great
               research potentials and commercial values. Referring technical
               advantages with hyperspectral and fluorescence lidar for
               monitoring plants, the synchronous observation with reflection
               and fluorescence signals achieved by one lidar system has
               attracted wide attention. This paper plans to design and
               construct a dual-mechanism lidar system that can obtain spatial
               information, reflection, and fluorescence signals simultaneously.
               How to select the optimal detected bands to the dual-mechanism
               lidar system for monitoring plants is an essential step.
               Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step wavelength selection
               method to determine the optimal bands combination by considering
               the spectral characteristic of reflection and fluorescence
               signals themselves, and the hardware performance of lidar units
               comprehensively. The optimal bands combination of 4 reflection
               bands of 481 nm, 541 nm, 711.5 nm, 775.5 nm, and 2 fluorescence
               bands of 686.5 nm, 737 nm was determined. Besides, compared with
               the original reflection or fluorescence bands, the overall
               accuracy and average accuracy of the optimal band combination
               were respectively improved by 2.51\%, 15.45\%, and 7.8\%,
               29.06\%. The study demonstrated the reliability and availability
               of the two-step wavelength selection method, and can provide
               references for dual-mechanism lidar system construction.",

               study examines the use of a fluorescence imaging device to detect
               deli residues on deli slicers. Four cheeses and four processed
               meats were used for testing. For each commodity, the slicer was
               scanned at 475, 520, and 675 nm after slicing five times, after
               washing, and after sanitation. A 405-nm light source was used to
               excite fluorescence responses. Hyperspectral data were acquired
               for identified problem areas, and the three wavelengths used for
               scanning proved adequate to detect all deli residues. Most
               residues were found in three areas: around the blade and blade
               guard, on the surface where commodities were pressed during
               slicing, and on and around the spikes in the arm used to hold
               commodities. The number of residues detected decreased with
               cleaning and then sanitation; however, it was impossible to fully
               clean the slicer without using the imagining device to direct
               cleaning efforts. It is suggested that a fluorescence imaging
               device, or something similar, be adopted for routine use in
               delicatessens.",
