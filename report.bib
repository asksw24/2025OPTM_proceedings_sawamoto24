  abstract  = "AbstractSociety has become increasingly reliant on plastics since
               commercial production began in about 1950. Their versatility,
               stability, light weight, and low production costs have fueled
               global demand. Most plastics are initially used and discarded on
               land. Nonetheless, the amount of microplastics in some oceanic
               compartments is predicted to double by 2030. To solve this global
               problem, we must understand plastic composition, physical forms,
               uses, transport, and fragmentation into microplastics (and
               nanoplastics). Plastic debris/microplastics arise from land
               disposal, wastewater treatment, tire wear, paint failure, textile
               washing, and at‐sea losses. Riverine and atmospheric transport,
               storm water, and disasters facilitate releases. In surface waters
               plastics/microplastics weather, biofoul, aggregate, and sink, are
               ingested by organisms and redistributed by currents. Ocean
               sediments are likely the ultimate destination. Plastics release
               additives, concentrate environmental contaminants, and serve as
               substrates for biofilms, including exotic and pathogenic species.
               Microplastic abundance increases as fragment size decreases, as

               additive bioavailability, and organismal and ecosystem health
               risks. Solutions include improving globally based pollution
               prevention, developing degradable polymers and additives, and

               waste, population density, and economic status, we estimated the
               mass of land-based plastic waste entering the ocean. We calculate
               that 275 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste was generated
               in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to 12.7 million MT

               necessitating the development of efficient analytical strategies
               for their detection to monitor their environmental impact. This
               study aims to define an optimal analytical protocol for
               characterizing MPs by hyperspectral imaging (HSI), comparing
               different setups based on spatial resolution, spectral range and
               classification models. The investigated MPs include polymers
               commonly found in the environment, such as polystyrene (PS),
               polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE),
               subdivided in three size classes (1000-2000 μm, 500-1000 μm,
               250-500 μm). Furthermore, MP particles with diameters ranging
               from 30 to 250 μm were assessed to determine the limit of
               detection (LOD) in the different configurations. Hyperspectral
               images were acquired with two spatial resolutions, 150 and 30
               μm/pixel, and two spectral ranges, 1000-1700 nm (NIR) and
               1000-2500 nm (SWIR). Three classification models, Partial Least
               Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Error Correction Output
               Coding-Support Vector Machine (ECOC-SVM) and Neural Network
               Pattern Recognition (NNPR) were tested on the acquired images.
               The correctness of these models was evaluated by prediction maps
               and statistical parameters (Recall, Specificity and Accuracy).
               The results demonstrated that for MP particles larger than 250
               μm, the optimal setup is a spatial resolution of 150 μm/pixel and
               a spectral range of 1000-1700 nm, utilizing a linear
               classification model like PLS-DA. This approach offers accurate
               predictions while being time- and cost-efficient. For MPs smaller
               than 250 μm, a higher spatial resolution of 30 μm/pixel with a
               spectral range of 1000-2500 nm and a non-linear classification
               method like ECOC-SVM is preferable. The LOD is 250 μm for the 150
               μm/pixel resolution and ranges from 100 to 200 μm for the 30
               μm/pixel resolution. These findings provide a valuable guide for
               selecting the appropriate HSI acquisition conditions and data
               processing methods to optimally characterize MPs of different
               sizes.",
